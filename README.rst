============================
cognito-assume-role
============================


Currently supports USER_SRP_AUTH and USER_PASSWORD_AUTH using enhanced Cognito auth flow.
Custom auth flows or administrative auth are not currently supported although I suppose
you could monkey patch the needed code. It was written using only public methods exposed by the boto3/botocore
API's to help ensure that changes to boto3 won't break any (what would be otherwise) monkey patched code.
This should also maintain the ability to use this library for your boto3 calls that are not using Cognito within
the same script by simply passing a normal boto3 client credential argument.

**USAGE**:
This module can insert a botocore.credentials.CredentialProvider into the provider chain.
Using this provider we can assume an IAM role through get_credentials_for_identity(). To do this
we provide three functions:
- client (wraps boto3.client())
- resource (wraps boto3.resource())
- Session (wraps boto3.session.Session())

All three of these functions accept all normal boto3 args and kwargs plus some that are specific to this module.
We provide three ways of providing the initial credentials.


**Env vars**
These will take affect before any other credential provider, including the standard env provider that looks for AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID.
If one or more of the following non-optional variables are found in environ then we will automatically go to env based credential mapping

- COGNITO_USERNAME
- COGNITO_PASSWORD
- COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID
- COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL_ID
- COGNITO_APP_ID
- COGNITO_METADATA (Deserialized and passed as ClientMetadata in boto3.client("cognito-idp").initiate_auth()) - Optional
- AWS_ROLE_ARN - Optional


**Profile**
Credential file locations, if not specified, will be resolved in the order of <argument to client>, "COGNITO_CREDENTIALS_FILE", "~/.aws/cognito_credentials".
Config files take the following form:

.. code-block:: toml

  [default]
  username=myusername
  password=***********
  app_id=1234567890
  user_pool_id=abcdefg
  identity_pool_id=us-east-1:1234567890
  region=us-east-1
  metadata={"foo": "bar"}
  auth_type=user_srp


All values except for region and metadata are required if using a profile. Using a profile is done by passing the kwarg "cognito_profile=<profile name>" to client, Session, or resource.


**Direct configuration**

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "username": "myusername",
    "password": "***********",
    "app_id": "1234567890",
    "user_pool_id": "abcdefg",
    "identity_pool_id": "us-east-1:1234567890",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "metadata": {"foo": "bar"},
    "auth_type": "user_srp"
  }

Same rules apply for required values as when using a profile. Direct configuration is done by passing the config dictionary to kwarg cognito_config when creating a client, resource, or Session.
Note that cognito_profile and cognito_config are mutually exclusive. Trying to use both at once will raise an Assertion exception.


**Auth types**
The client, resource, and Session functions also accept an argument of auth_type. This can be "user_srp" (default) or "user_password".


**Using the TokenFetcher**
If you don't want to assume a role but would still like to access cognito id tokens directly, for instance to make Appsync calls using the requests library, you
can use TokenFetcher. Instantiating the TokenFetcher will write the results from the Cognito login into boto3's JSONFileCache, where they can be accessed by properties
on your object. Subsequently you can call TokenFetcher.fetch() to update those credentials. For long running processes you can start a daemon that will keep the
credentials updated by passing "server=True".

.. code-block:: python

  from cognito_assume_role import TokenFetcher

  s = TokenFetcher()
  # Strings shortened for brevity
  print(s.id_token[-10:-1])
  print(s.access_token[-10:-1])
  print(s.refresh_token[-10:-1])
  print(s.expires)

**Creating a client that uses a config**

.. code-block:: python

  from cognito_assume_role import client

  client = boto3.client("s3", profile="my_profile")
  client.list_buckets()


**Using resource with env vars and specifying auth_type and region**

.. code-block:: python

  from cognito_assume_role import resource

  resource = boto3.resource("s3", auth_type="user_password", region_name="us-east-2")
  resource.create_bucket(Bucket="my-file-dump-woot-woot")


**Creating a session that we can reuse for multiple clients**

.. code-block:: python

  from cognito_assume_role import Session
  session = Session(auth_type="user_srp", region_name="us-east-2")
  s3 = session.client("s3")
  dynamo = resource("dynamodb")
  table = dynamo.Table("my_table")


**Precedence of CredentialProviders**
The order of resolution for credential providers remains unchanged except for setting environment variables for Cognito will take affect
before any AWS credential environment variables.

**Precedence of arguments**
Any value that can be defined in either an environment variable, explicitly passed as a kwarg ( passed to client, resource, or Session)
or can be part of a config or profile is resolved in the following order:

- explicit arguments
- specified by config or profile
- environment variables


Next minor release will automatically look for configuration files in the same way that boto3 does for standard credentials.
